                <h1>True Freedom Fighter</h1>
                <p><strong>Subhas Chandra Bose</strong>, popularly known as Netaji, was a
                    great militant, freedom fighter and a patriot.He was born in Cuttack, Orissa on 23rd January 1897
                    to Janakinath Bose and Prabhavati Devi. His father Janakinath Bose was a well-known lawyer of his
                    time. His mother Prabhavati Devi was a religious woman. Subhash Chandra was a brilliant student who
                    had scored the second position in the matriculation exam. At an early age, he started reading about
                    Swami Vivekananda and Ramakrishna and was influenced by their teachings. Bose completed his B.A.
                    Hons in Philosophy in 1918 from the University of Calcutta. He later went to England in September
                    1919 for further studies. He was selected for the Indian Civil Service but he did not want to stay
                    in England and serve the British government. Subhash Chandra resigned from his Civil Service job in
                    1921 and returned to India after hearing of the national turmoil in India. From a young age, Subhash
                    Chandra Bose had the nationalist temperament and Britishers’ discrimination towards Indians would
                    fill him with rage. To serve the country, he joined the Indian National Congress (also known as the
                    Congress Party). Bose joined the Noncooperation Movement, started by Gandhi under his influence.
                    Bose was a revolutionary freedom fighter who was known to have founded the Azad Hind Army or Indian
                    National Army.<b>“Tum Mujhe Khoon do main tumhe Azadi dunga”</b> was his motto for country’s independence. For his revolutionary movements, Bose had been to jail several times. He was
                    suspected of connections with secret revolutionary movements and was sent to Mandalay Jail in Burma
                    (Myanmar) where he contracted Tuberculosis. Bose was elected the president of Congress party and
                    worked along with Jawahar Lal Nehru. Both had a more militant and
                    left-wing approach to Independence, which became a reason for Bose’s differences with Gandhi and
                    other Congress leaders. Bose’s selfless contribution to India’s Independence Movement and organizing
                    and leading the Indian National Army is indispensable. His struggle of Independence was highlighted
                    during the Civil Disobedience Movement for which he had even been arrested. In fact, he was
                    imprisoned 11 times for his ideologies and the use of force against the British. Bose was elected
                    the president of the Indian National Congress twice but he resigned from the post as he was against
                    the congress internal and foreign policy. Soon, he left the party and went out of the country
                    seeking an alliance with other countries to fight against British forces. He earned the support of
                    the Japanese and they agreed to help him in forming the Indian national army in Southeast Asia.
                    Later on, he became the commander of the INA. The Indian National Army attacked the North-eastern
                    parts of India. This attack took place under the leadership of Subhash Chandra Bose and he was even
                    successful in acquiring a few portions of the north-eastern parts of India. Unfortunately, the
                    surrender of the Japanese forced him to withdraw and call off the war. It is believed that he died
                    in a plane crash on 18th August 1945. Subash Chandra Bose was an unforgettable national hero who
                    fought for the country’s freedom struggle against the British till his last breath. He is known to
                    be one of the greatest heroes the country has ever seen!</p>
